# Mathematica-Chess #

## Introducing Mathematica-Chess ##
This Project has been created during the Oxford WLAS18 *(Wolfram Language Autumn School)*.
The goal was to create a project, in order to discover the language. After hours of reflexion, we decided to create a chess game.

Of course, it's not finished yet because the Autumn School was not long enough.
But we'll continue to create, develop and improve the game to something great we'll share to the community.

## What's next ? ##
Now, we'd like to add more content and fix bugs. Here is the list of we'll do as soon as possible:
- Add Chessmate
- Add and finish castling
- Add a timer for movements
- Finish promotion system
- Improve UI by adding a way to know which player has to play
- Create an AI and improve it

## Important information ##
In order to run the code, you'll need mathematica installed on your computer. You can find more information [here](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) about the software.\
The License of the package (and all this git's content) can be found [here](LICENSE.md).

## About Oxford WLAS18 ##
Here is the list of all projects which has been done :
- Chess Game
- Tetris Game
- Tracking Hugogo (Video to Stickman Graph converter)
- Disease propagation in an hospital
- Reducing CO2 emission in the USA

If you're wondering if it's interesting to go to the WLAS or to the WLSS, the following lines are for you :\
*You'll discover a programming language which is particularly adapted for mathematics. You can compute loads of things, that other languages can't do (or not as simpler). With Mathematica, you can do whatever you want, without having computing knowledge (or almost without). You can render your results with just a few lines of code, solve equations on the fly, use data from the wolfram's databases (on almost every topic)... And more than coding and creating programs, you'll have fun with an awesome group and all the activities you'll take part in.* â€• Alban Sdl 2018

## Special Thanks ##
- Paul Abbott, who helped us to discover the language and who introduced to us some ways to create things (mostly UI)
- Alex Upellini, who made all this story possible, by organising WLAS
- Guillaume Saes, who helped fixing bugs
- The Wolfram Research, for having invited us in their center
- The whole WLAS18 group, for having so fun
